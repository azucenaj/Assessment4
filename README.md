The application isn't finished due to lots of issues required to be handled within a week. The following functionality that can be expected to be seen are:
Front end client
Log in and create account
post and like

The following function are currently in issues and most codes are on local drive and sompe parts are not have been upload due to the parts cause discrepancies on the other functionality:
Upload image file
Authentication
Chat functionality
Update and delete functionality

Please use your own MONGO URL and execute in seperate command prompt the following:
1st command prompt
cd client
npm start client
2nd command prompt
cd api
npm start api

I uploaded the dependencies due to the new dependencies online are not compatible anymore with my old logic and will require time to readjust the whole concept design.
the following routes can be accessed via local host
localhost3000/
localhost3000/login
localhost3000/signup
localhost3000/profile

If I would be given time, I can publish this online functioning properly.
